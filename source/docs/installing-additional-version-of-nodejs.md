If you need to install an additional Node.js version which is not available in the default Semaphore VM, use the following commands.

```bash

nvm install v0.x.x
nvm use v0.x.x
# followed by your build commands

```

You can find the list of avaliable Node.js version on our [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
