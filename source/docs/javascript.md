Semaphore uses [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage NodeJS versions and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) to install your project's dependecies.

If you like to manage your packages a little differently, we also have support for [bower](https://npmjs.org/package/bower) and you can use [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for automation.

The list of the avaliable Node.js versions can be found on our [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html#node_version) page.
